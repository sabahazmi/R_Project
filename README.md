# Rating Prediction on Amazon Book Review
This research proposed a best performing prediction model on the data science book reviews in Amazon platform. The aim is to find the best performing prediction model from the selected algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset contains unstructured comments extracted as the text features in the prediction model. The data is split into 75:25 training-test ratio with the 5-fold cross validation for parameter tuning. Accuracy is used as the performance metrics. Upon examination of the result, Radial kernel SVM with the parameter C=1, sigma=1 yields the highest test accuracy at 68%. This result will allow more consideration of rating prediction on other domains and may contribute to future research of rating prediction using machine learning techniques.
